# openCV_object_tracking
Object Tracking using OpenCV w/ python

WHAT DOES THIS DO
This program uses python and the openCV library to track and predict future locations of objects in traffic footage.

BEFORE YOU RUN:
To utilize this program, you must first follow the install and environment setup instructions on pysource's video, "Object Tracking from scratch with OpenCV and Python"
Link: https://youtu.be/GgGro5IV-cs?t=60
Requirements: 
  Python installed on your system (I used Python Version 3.10.7) 
  opencv-python library installed
Why: Github's upload limits are surpassed by the files included in the environment setup, more specifically, there is a weights file that is 251MB which is well over the 50MB upload requirement

To run, navigate to your project directory containing, "object_tracking.py" and run the command: "python object_tracking.py"
